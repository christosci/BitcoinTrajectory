            <p>People who are first introduced to Bitcoin often ask questions like "does bitcoin have any value?" 
            or "what will it be worth five to ten years from now?"</p>

            <p>Statisticians, Data scientists and econometricians have sought to answer these questions by constructing 
            various statistical models. The results of which are often presented in the form of visualizations.</p>

            <p>Given that Bitcoin is a constantly evolving digital asset, it is imperative to present the latest network and exchange data
            in visualizations, such that we can easily judge the accuracy of a model.<p>
            <p>However, many visualizations posted in websites, forums, and research papers
            are no longer maintained by their authors.</p>
            
            <p>BitcoinTrajectory.com seeks to solve this problem by providing a curated list of visualizations, all in one place, 
            all updated on a daily basis.</p>
